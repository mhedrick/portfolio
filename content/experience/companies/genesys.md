I worked on a team responsible for the internal project management, quoting, and reporting tool used by Interactive Intelligence, and later Genesys.  I started out as a general developer somewhat focused on the front end, to the team's front-end and UI/UX developer. By that point I was the lead on JavaScript/UI development on the team, and was responsible for code reviews and mock ups using Sketch for all front facing features.
