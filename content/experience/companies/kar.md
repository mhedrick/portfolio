I am currently the product owner for an SRE team assisting with the Carvana sale.  I've been a general purpose SRE product owner for the three years I've been here - generally working over 2-3 teams with a combined backlog.  As of June 2021 I took on additional responsibilities as the sole product role in the KAR SRE organization.
