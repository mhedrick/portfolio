As a product owner in the KAR Global IT department, I worked with 2-3 teams, usually with combined backlogs.  My teams were in automation, infrastructure, and as of June 2021 I took on additional responsibilities as the sole product role in the KAR SRE organization.  I aided in the transition of ADESA to Carvana for about five months.
