                <p>
                    I'm a former <em>web developer</em> turned <em>product owner</em> living in Indianapolis, Indiana.
                    I've been programming professionally since 2013.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many people, I got my start on the web as a youth with geocities and neopets.  I signed up
                    for a programming class in high school (VB6 baby!) and discovered that I really, <em>really</em> enjoyed
                    programming. I went to Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) and recieved a degree
                    in <em>Computer Science</em>, with a minor in German.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started out in web development in 2013 using <em>Knockout.js</em> and <em>C#</em>.  Once at <em>Interactive
                        Intelligence</em>, I started in more heavily with <em>ASP.NET</em> as well as <em>Bootstrap 3</em>.  Eventually
                    we started an upgrade POC of our applications to <em>React</em> with a <em>Java</em> backend. While at
                    Interactive/Genesys, I handled the UX and branding of our applications.  I would build UI mockups using <em>Sketch</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now as a <em>product owner</em> for IT infrastructure (mainly SRE teams these days), I spend a lot of time managing
                    backlogs, prioritizing work, and <strike>herding cats</strike> creating roadmaps.  A lot of what I love about product
                    as well as web development is the user experience. I am ideally looking for something which combines both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy gardening, cross stitch, and reading.  I own a husky (Miko), seven emerald corydora,
                    and two eastern spotted newts, as well as countless isopods and springtails.  I also love video games; my
                    current favorites are Garden Story and Graveyard Keeper.  I'm always playing Animal Crossing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for stopping by.
